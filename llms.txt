# Don't Code That By Hand

> A satirical decision tool for the vibe coding era. Should you write this code yourself, or just vibe it with AI?

## About

dontcode.work is a simple, interactive web tool that helps developers decide whether to write code manually or delegate it to AI. It uses a weighted scoring system based on seven factors to produce a verdict.

## How It Works

Users rate their situation on seven parameters (scale 1-10):

1. **Boilerplate level** - Higher = lean toward AI
2. **Learning value** - Higher = lean toward writing yourself
3. **Code commonality** - More common = lean toward AI
4. **Joy factor** - More enjoyment = lean toward writing yourself
5. **Urgency** - More urgent = lean toward AI
6. **Complexity** - More complex = lean toward writing yourself (need control)
7. **Ego check** - Avoiding AI because it feels like "cheating" = lean toward AI

The tool calculates a weighted percentage and delivers a sassy verdict ranging from "Just vibe it" to "Go full artisan."

## The Vibe Coding Philosophy

Your value as a developer isn't in typing speed or memorizing syntax—it's in knowing what to build, understanding the problem, and directing the solution. The AI handles the syntax. You handle the semantics.
