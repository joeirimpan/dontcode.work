# Vibe it or code it?

Visit [**dont.code**](https://dont.code).

A satirical decision tool for the vibe coding era. Should you write this code yourself, or just vibe it with AI?

We've entered a new era. Your value as a developer isn't in typing speed or memorizing syntax—it's in *knowing what to build*, *understanding the problem*, and *directing the solution*. The AI handles the syntax. You handle the semantics.

Inspired by [dont.build](https://dont.build) and [dontspend.money](https://dontspend.money).
